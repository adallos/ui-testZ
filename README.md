# UI Test - Rule of Thumb
This is my submission for the UI-test of Zemoga as a FED. N: A Dallos.

## Improvements

At the moment of making the first fetch and saving to Local Storage, the first fetch will fail due to an improper management of the information. You can reload once and it will work.
Still, this is something that could be managed by making a better use of the Local Storage.
Also, I've managed the state of the app using a Store that might be more than what is needed to solve the problem. Another solution could be a implementing a smaller store such as one with a globalState hook.

## Getting Started
